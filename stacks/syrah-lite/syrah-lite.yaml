# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT SECTION (PE)
#
# The PE section follows the syntax: <pe_name>_<stack_name>_<package_name>.
# for example: intel_stable_compiler. There is a parent child schema that must
# be respected. The metadata key is ignored for this purpose. The core PE only
# has one information and does not follow the same schema. Any key under the
# <package_name> will be seen as a filter or it will be ignored. In the future
# we may need to introduce a stack key and a dependencies key for the case where
# we want to compile the compiler or stack libraries with GPU support. For now,
# the core_compiler should have this name (this means 'core' key and 'compiler'
# for subkey. We can also set section:core for the core PE.
